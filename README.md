(ENG)  This Power Inverter is a backup power supply using a 12V battery that will invert it to 220V AC. Using this Power Inverter we can use your appliances like TV, Radio, Audio system as well as lightings like a bulb, fluorescent, etc. This inverter has three main parts: 12V Battery, Inverter Board, and Centertapped Transformer. This inverter has a Tl494 PWM IC that provides a pulse with modulation, the two output pins of this PWM ic are responsible for ON state and OFF state of the power mosfet. Power Mosfet (IRFZ44N) i is a specific type of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor designed to handle significant power levels. The drain terminal of the MOSFET is connected to the center-tapped of the transformer, the power MOSFET is ON and OFF synchronize to the PWM IC output pin, and the Centertapped transformer are in STEP UP condition (from 12V DC to 22OV AC). The power of inverter are dependent to the power capacity of the battery and transformer. This inverter has Reverse polarity protection, wherein if you connected the battery in the WRONG WAY the inverter is safe, because of this 1N4148 (1A). 1N4148 diode has a lower voltage drop compared to the other diode. Therefore the power losses are significantly lower compared to other diodes. This inverter is in the square waveform, therefore you can only use it in resistive load like a bulb, and also you can use it and an electronic device like TV's.
(DEU)  Dieser Power Inverter ist eine Notstromversorgung, die eine 12V Batterie verwendet und diese in 220V AC umwandelt. Mit diesem Power Inverter können Sie Ihre Geräte wie Fernseher, Radio, Audiosystem sowie Beleuchtungen wie Glühbirnen, Leuchtstofflampen usw. nutzen.
