This Power Inverter is a backup power supply using a 12V battery that will invert it to 220V AC. Using this Power Inverter we can use your appliances like TV, Radio, Audio system as well as lightings like a bulb, fluorescent, etc. This inverter has three main parts: 12V Battery, Inverter Board, and Centertapped Transformer. This inverter has a Tl494 PWM IC that provides a pulse with modulation, the two output pins of this PWM ic are responsible for ON state and OFF state of the power mosfet. Power Mosfet (IRFZ44N) i is a specific type of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor designed to handle significant power levels.
